Python API Homework


Three Observable Trends:

NOTE:  Since the results are based on current weather, the output (particularly for the VacationPy part) varies depending on the time of day this was run.  (I had significantly fewer ideal cities for the VacationPy exercise when I ran the Weather API in the morning vs re-running in the afternoon.)

1)  There is a very strong correlation between the Latitute and Max temperature (closer to the equator, the warmer temperature you can expect).  

2)  The correlation is stronger with the Northern Hemisphere vs Southern Hemisphere, likely due to the Earth's current tilt & seasons.

3)  There is little to no correlation with the Latitude and Humidity, Cloudiness, or Wind Speed.
